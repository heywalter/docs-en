# TapData vs. Kafka

Both TapData and Apache Kafka enable real-time data movement—but they’re designed for different audiences and use cases.

**Kafka** is a powerful foundation for custom, developer-built event systems that typically require development effort. **TapData** is data integration platform designed with no code or low code data engineering in mind.

This guide helps you decide which fits your goals—or how they can work together.

## Comparing TapData and Apache Kafka

| Capability              | **TapData**                                         | **Apache Kafka**                          |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| **Purpose**             | Unified platform for real-time CDC, transform, APIs | Event streaming backbone                  |
| **Setup Time**          | Minutes (no code, UI-driven)                        | Weeks (custom setup & plugins)            |
| **Change Data Capture** | Built-in for 100+ sources                           | Requires Debezium / custom dev            |
| **Transformation**      | UI + SQL/JS logic + IMV support                     | Requires Flink/Kafka Streams              |
| **Serving Layer**       | Real-time REST/GraphQL APIs                         | Requires additional systems               |
| **Schema Handling**     | Auto-detect, versioned, GUI-managed                 | Manual Registry config                    |
| **Ops & Scaling**       | Built-in auto-scaling and alerting                  | Requires manual tuning + external tooling |
| **Learning Curve**      | Low-code, team-friendly                             | Steep (Java/Scala required)               |
| **Pricing Model**       | Predictable SaaS pricing (pipeline + volume) | Open source core, but hidden enterprise costs <br />(Confluent, infra, ops) |



## What Makes TapData Different

### Built for Speed, Not Complexity

Launch pipelines across 100+ sources in minutes. No need to wire together Kafka + Debezium + Flink—TapData does it all in one place.

### Transformations Made Easy

Join, clean, deduplicate, mask, and enrich data—**visually** or with lightweight JS/SQL. Ideal for both operational and analytical use cases.

### Incremental Materialized Views (IMV)

Skip nightly rebuilds. TapData lets you cache joined, aggregated, or filtered views that auto-refresh as source data changes.

### API-Ready by Design

Publish any pipeline output as a versioned REST or GraphQL API, complete with row/column-level permissions. No extra backend needed.

### Layered Architecture

TapData promotes reusability and control through layered design:

- **FDM**: Mirror raw source tables via CDC
- **MDM**: Transform into wide, analytics-ready business entities
- **ADM**: Deliver via APIs, pipelines, or data sync



## When TapData Makes Sense

Use TapData when:

- You need real-time pipelines **ready in days**, not weeks
- You want **CDC + transform + APIs in one UI**
- You support **business apps** that rely on fresh, accurate data
- You want **low maintenance**—no Kafka tuning, no Flink jobs

**Example:**
 “Sync Salesforce, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB into a real-time user view, apply masking, and publish as an API—in 2 hours.”



## When Kafka Excels

Kafka is your best bet when:

- You’re building **custom event architectures**
- You need **ultra-high throughput** (1M+ events/sec)
- Your team has **deep streaming expertise**

**Example:**
 “Build a fraud detection engine with Flink jobs on raw Kafka streams.”



## TapData + Kafka: Better Together

TapData can simplify and supercharge your Kafka stack.

| Use Case                          | Flow Diagram                               | TapData Benefits                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CDC Frontend for Kafka**        | DBs → TapData → Kafka Topics               | Visual UI for schema handling, masking, filtering, and deduplication |
| **Serving Layer on Top of Kafka** | Kafka Topics → TapData → REST/GraphQL APIs | Exposes topics as secure, queryable APIs—no need to build API layers manually |

**Why this hybrid works:**
Kafka excels at raw event distribution. TapData brings **developer experience, governance, and business access**—all while staying real-time.



## Final Takeaways

1. **TapData = Real-Time Simplicity**
    Pipelines, transformations, IMVs, and APIs—fully managed, no code required.
2. **Kafka = Custom-Built Power**
    Ideal for teams building large-scale, event-first architectures from the ground up.
3. **Together = The Best of Both Worlds**
    TapData reduces the engineering effort to adopt, extend, and operationalize Kafka.
