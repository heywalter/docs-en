# Benefits

## Innovative Real-time Data Synchronization

Tapdata ingeniously integrates database Change Data Capture (CDC) with streaming computing technology. This innovative integration simplifies the data processing workflow, empowering users to explore new and inventive possibilities beyond traditional data synchronization.

## Unified Data Service Platform

Based on the concept of data hierarchical governance, data scattered in different business systems can be synchronized to a unified platform cache layer, which minimizes the impact of data extraction on business and provides basic data for subsequent data processing and business, thus building a consistent, real-time data platform and connecting data silos.

## Zero Code Visual Drag and Drop

The orchestration and configuration process for Tapdata data synchronization tasks is seamlessly accomplished through intuitive drag-and-drop visual operations, eliminating the need for coding. Additionally, it supports multi-level and multi-node synchronization operations, effectively simplifying the definition of synchronization task flows and enhancing overall efficiency and quality.

## Perfect Support for SQL - > NoSQL

Tapdata provides extensive JSON support, enabling effortless real-time synchronization from relational databases to non-relational data using intuitive drag-and-drop operations. It also supports various modeling methods, including one-to-one, many-to-one, and one-to-many, making it simple for users to modernize their databases.

## Comprehensive Database Support

Tapdata provides comprehensive support for major open source databases, commercial databases, and messaging middleware, including MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Db2, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Sybase, PostgreSQL, Redis, GaussDB, and more.

## Enhanced Task Monitoring with Visual Monitoring

Through the intuitive visual interface, users can monitor the operational status of tasks and access real-time statistics related to data reading, data writing, and delay for different tasks and nodes.

## Fully Designed Security

Ensuring the security of user data and task information is a top priority in the design of Tapdata. The platform employs encryption mechanisms throughout its security measures to provide comprehensive protection for user data and information.
