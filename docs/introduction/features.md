This article introduces the features of TapData to help you quickly understand its core capabilities.

## Data Replication

TapData offers support for both full data synchronization and real-time incremental data synchronization. TapData can help you to quickly achieve real-time synchronization between the same/heterogeneous data sources, which is suitable for data migration/synchronization, data disaster recovery, reading performance expansion, and other [business scenarios](use-cases.md).

## Data transformation

Aiming at complex data processing needs, TapData supports a variety of [processing nodes](../user-guide/data-development/process-node.md) between data sources based on data replication capabilities. These nodes provide advanced data processing capabilities such as data splitting, field addition, and deletion, and shared mining.

## Real-Time Data Hub

With TapData's [Real-Time Data Hub](../user-guide/real-time-data-hub/daas-mode/enable-daas-mode.md), you can synchronize data scattered in different business systems to a unified platform cache layer, which can provide basic data for subsequent data processing, while avoiding the performance impact of directly reading/manipulating the source database. This helps create a consistent, real-time data platform and connects disparate data silos.
