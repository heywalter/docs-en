# Query API through RESTful


RESTful API is an application programming interface (API or Web API) that adheres to REST architectural specifications. TapData supports integrated RESTful API services, allowing you to execute requests through the API service address and obtain managed data information.

In this article, we will introduce how to use the Postman to invoke API requests.

## Procedure

1. [Log in to TapData Platform](../user-guide/log-in.md).

2. In the left navigation bar, select **Data Services** > **API List**.

3. Obtain the service access address and Access Token authentication information.

   1. Locate and click on the target service name.

   2. Scroll down to the service access area in the right-hand panel and get the address for service access. In this case, we will demonstrate the procedure using a **GET** type service as an example.
