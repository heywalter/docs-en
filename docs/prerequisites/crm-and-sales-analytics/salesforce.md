2. In the left navigation panel, click **Connections**.

3. On the right side of the page, click **Create**.

4. In the pop-up **dialog**, select **Salesforce**.

   * **Connection type**: Salesforce is only supported as a Source.
   * **Authorization**: Click Authorize, and on the page that you are redirected to, log in to your Salesforce account to complete the authorization (recommended as an administrator).

      After completing the operation, the page will return to the data source configuration page and display **Authorization successful**.
   * **Agent settings**: Defaults to **Platform automatic allocation**, you can also manually specify an agent.
   * **Model load time**: If there are less than 10,000 models in the data source, their information will be updated every hour. But if the number of models exceeds 10,000, the refresh will take place daily at the time you have specified.

6. Click **Test Connection**, and when passed, click **Save**.
