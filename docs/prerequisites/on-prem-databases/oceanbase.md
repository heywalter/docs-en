## Preparation

1. Ensure that the network to which TapData Agent belongs has been added to the [tenant whitelist](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001166968) of OceanBase.

2. Log in to the tenant as the `root` user.

3. Execute the command in the following format to create a user for data synchronization.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   ```
   
   * **username**: Username.
   * **password**: Password.
   
4. Execute the command in the following format to grant the newly created user all permissions at the database level. You can also customize more fine-grained [permission control](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001169862) based on business needs.

   ```sql
   GRANT ALL ON database_name.* TO username;
   ```
   
   * **database_name**: Database name.
   * **username**: Username.
