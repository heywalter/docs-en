## Preparation

1. Log in to the Databend database and execute the following command to create an account for data synchronization/development tasks:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   ```

   - **username**: The username.
   - **password**: The password.

   Example: Create an account named tapdata.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'Tap@123456';
   ```

2. Grant the newly created account all privileges on a specified database, so that TapData Cloud can automatically create the target tables for synchronization. You can also set more granular permissions based on business needs. For more, see [GRANT Syntax](https://databend.rs/doc/sql-commands/ddl/user/grant-privileges).

   ```sql
   -- Replace database_name and username as per the instructions below
   GRANT ALL ON database_name.* TO username;
   ```

   * **database_name**: The name of the database to grant permissions to.
   * **username**: The username.
