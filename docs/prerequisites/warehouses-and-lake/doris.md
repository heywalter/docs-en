Apache Doris is a new-generation open-source real-time data warehouse based on MPP architecture, with easier use and higher performance for big data analytics. TapData Cloud supports Doris as a source or target database to build data pipelines to help you quickly complete data flow in big data analytics scenarios.

Next, follow this article to connect a Doris data source on the TapData Cloud platform.

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

## Supported Versions

Dorix 1.x, 2.x

import Content from '../../reuse-content/_beta.md';

## Precautions

If you want to use Doris as the source database to synchronize incremental data changes, you need to [create a data transformation task](../../user-guide/data-pipeline/data-development/create-task.md) and select **Incremental Synchronization Method** as the **Polling**.

## Preparations

1. To create an account, log in to the Doris database and run the following commands.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   ```

   - **username**: Enter user name.
   - **password**: Enter password.
   - **host**: Which host can be accessed by the account, percent (%) means to allow all host.

   Example: Create an account named tapdata.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'tapdata'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Tap@123456';
   ```

2. Grant permissions to the account we just created, we recommend setting more granular permissions control based on business needs.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
<TabItem value="As a Source Database">
```
```sql
-- Replace the catalog_name, database_name, and username follow the tips below
GRANT SELECT_PRIV ON catalog_name.database_name.* TO 'username'@'%';
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="As a Target Database">

```sql
-- Replace the catalog_name, database_name, and username follow the tips below
GRANT SELECT_PRIV, ALTER_PRIV, CREATE_PRIV, DROP_PRIV, LOAD_PRIV ON catalog_name.database_name.* TO 'username'@'%';
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

Please replace the username, password, and host in the command above.
* **catalog_name**: The name of the data catalog. The default name is **internal**. You can view the created data catalog through the [SHOW CATALOGS](https://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/1.2/sql-manual/sql-reference/Show-Statements/SHOW-CATALOGS) command. For more information, see [Multi Catalog](https://doris.apache.org/docs/1.2/lakehouse/multi-catalog/).
* **database_name**: Enter database name.
* **username**: Enter user name.
