If the correct permissions have been [granted](#preparations), can be checked and fixed by:

1. Execute the following command to see if the value of the Grant_priv field is **Y**, where **username** needs to be replaced with the real user name.

   ```sql
   SELECT host,user,Grant_priv,Super_priv FROM Doris.user where user='username';
   ```



2. If the value is not **Y**, execute the following command, where **username** needs to be replaced with the real username.

   ```sql
   UPDATE Doris.user SET Grant_priv='Y' WHERE user='username';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
