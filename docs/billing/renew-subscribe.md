# Manage Subscription

For annual/monthly subscription instances, TapData Cloud will remind you to renew one month before the expiration date. To avoid any impact on your business, please renew your subscription in time before it expires, or choose the **Continuous Annual/Monthly** billing method at the time of purchase. Additionally, you can view traffic bills in the Subscription Center.



## Procedure

1. Log in to [TapData Cloud](https://cloud.tapdata.io/).

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Subscriptions**.

3. View your current subscription information, locate the target instance, and choose the action you wish to perform:

   - **Renew**: Renew the instance. If you have a continuous annual/monthly subscription, this action is not required.
   - **Change**: Upgrade the instance specifications and follow the prompts to complete the payment process. You can also view the instance change history.
   - **Unsubscribe**: If the instance is no longer needed, you can [unsubscribe](refund.md) as long as its associated tasks do not impact your business.
   - **Authorization Code**: This section displays the authorization code information for Agent instances purchased through the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace. You can choose to issue invoices or renew subscriptions.
   - **Traffic Bill**: View the traffic bills for data synchronization, with charges billed monthly.
