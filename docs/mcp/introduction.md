# MCP Server Introduction

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol designed to provide structured business data in real time to AI models, enhancing their understanding of business context. With the **Tapdata MCP Server**, you can integrate, anonymize, and publish data from multiple heterogeneous systems as real-time contextual views that can be dynamically accessed by LLMs (Large Language Models) or AI Agents. 

This solution is especially suitable for enterprise scenarios with high demands for data freshness and compliance, such as financial risk control, intelligent customer service, and personalized recommendation.

## Background

As digital transformation accelerates, more enterprises are leveraging AI models for real-time business decision-making. However, in practice, they face the following challenges:

- AI models often lack effective access to real-time business data, leading to poor inference accuracy and hallucinations.
- Enterprise data is typically scattered across systems like CRM, core banking, ERP, etc., creating data silos.
- Due to data security and compliance requirements, AI models are often prohibited from directly accessing raw databases.

To address these challenges, Tapdata provides the MCP service. It uses a standardized SSE protocol, along with real-time materialized views and data anonymization, to securely and efficiently deliver structured context to AI models. The model can access real-time business context **without** direct database connections, significantly improving inference accuracy and enabling trustworthy AI adoption in enterprises. This forms a unified AI Context Service Layer.

## Key Benefits

- **Secure access to real-time data with trusted and controlled context**

  Supports field-level data masking, access isolation, and permission control. Combined with multi-source real-time sync and incremental processing to ensure safe delivery of fresh data to AI models.

- **Optimized structure and contextual modeling for efficient queries**

  Allows graphical design of wide tables by merging multiple sources and building real-time materialized views using an intermediate data layer. No need to connect directly to source databases, improving AI query performance.

- **Compatible with mainstream model frameworks and agent ecosystems**

  Offers a standardized SSE protocol for streaming context data, along with no-code REST API configuration. Compatible with popular agent tools like Cursor MCP and Claude.

- **Connects to 100+ data sources to unify enterprise data pipelines**

  Supports integration with over 100 mainstream databases and SaaS platforms, enabling centralized management of heterogeneous data and eliminating silos. Provides a solid data foundation for context generation and multi-scenario inference.
