# Manage Connection

Tapdata Cloud saves the connection information of each database through connection, so that you can reference directly when creating data replication/development tasks, without repeated configuration, and improve the convenience of operation and maintenance. This article describes the common O&M operations of the connection.

## Procedure

1. Log in to [Tapdata Cloud](https://cloud.tapdata.io/).

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Connections**.

3. Select the actions you want to perform.

   * **Connection test**: Test whether the connection is valid. You can troubleshoot according to the prompts in the dialog box if abnormalities are found.
   * **Load Schema**: Manually loads database schema information.
   * **Edit**: Mmodify the name and configuration information of the connection.
   * **Copy**: Quickly clone a connection with the same configuration based on the specified connection.
   * **Delete**: If you no longer need a connection, you can delete it, but keep in mind that it cannot be recovered.
