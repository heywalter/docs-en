Establish a connection between the Agent and the database on Tapdata Cloud after [installing the Agent](../../quick-start/install-agent). Then you can create data synchronization tasks.

Before connecting to the database, please ensure that the network environment is accessible and the database account has been authorized. For more information, see [Preparation](../../prerequisites/README.md).

Please refer to the following documents based on your database type to complete the database connection:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
