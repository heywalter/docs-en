# Real-Time Data Hub

Tapdata Cloud implements data hierarchical governance by collecting data from disparate sources across multiple business systems through the **Data Cache Layer**. 

This approach minimizes the disruption to business operations during data extraction and establishes a foundation for subsequent data processing and business activities. It enables the creation of a consistent and real-time data platform, fostering the connection of data silos and promoting data integration and accessibility throughout the organization.
