# Benefits

Tapdata offers robust capabilities for data flow between a wide range of data sources, providing core functions such as data replication, data transformation, and data services. Compared to traditional data migration/synchronization tools, Tapdata provides a feature-rich, easy-to-use, and secure data flow service, significantly enhancing data development efficiency.

## Comprehensive Data Sources Support

Supports mainstream open-source databases, offline files, cloud applications, and lakehouse data sources. For more details, see [Supported Data Sources](supported-databases.md).

Additionally, Tapdata redefines data source detection items based on the data source registration framework, ensuring stable and reliable operation of data processing tasks.

## Zero-Code Graphical Interface

Tapdata supports task orchestration and settings through drag-and-drop operations, and supports multi-level, multi-node synchronization operations simultaneously, greatly reducing the complexity of defining synchronization task flows, thus improving efficiency and quality.

## Flexible Definition of Data Processing Logic

On top of data replication, Tapdata provides a series of [data processing nodes](../user-guide/data-pipeline/data-development/process-node.md) for single-table development (such as master-slave merging, field calculation, etc.). You can define your own data processing logic to meet scenarios like data analysis, processing, and disaster recovery.

## Visual Task Monitoring

Tapdata supports visual monitoring of task operation status, allowing you to quickly obtain key monitoring information such as data read statistics, data write statistics, and latency statistics for nodes in the data chain.

## Shared Log Mining

Tapdata employs shared mining technology, extracting logs from the source database to a cache database. Data replication tasks, acting as consumers, directly read data from the cache database, achieving rapid synchronization of data changes. This approach avoids issues such as performance impact on the source database due to multiple tasks reading the logs simultaneously, loss of large transactions, and traceability issues in data synchronization faults commonly seen in traditional approaches.

## Real-Time Incremental Data Verification

Tapdata supports real-time comparison of the data synchronized to the target database with the source database on an incremental data synchronization basis to ensure consistency and completeness without the need for SQL script verification, avoiding the time-consuming issues of full verification.

## High Availability and Fault Tolerance

Tapdata supports high availability deployment and on-demand scaling. The management side itself, through dual nodes and three copies of the distributed database, can ensure 99.99% system high availability, comfortably meeting the stringent requirements of production environments.

Furthermore, Tapdata provides idempotent operations to ensure tasks can continue running and data eventually remains consistent, as follows:

- Data processing tasks periodically report their health status to the management side. If the management side does not receive a report within 1 minute, it deems the processing node abnormal and another normal node takes over the task.
- Data processing tasks periodically record the current position of the processing flow. Upon restart, the task automatically resumes from that position.
