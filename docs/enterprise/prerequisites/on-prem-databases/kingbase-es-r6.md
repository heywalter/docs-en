# KingbaseES-R6

KingbaseES-R6 is a domestically developed database based on the open-source PostgreSQL database. R6 is compatible with the majority of features from PostgreSQL version 9.6. Currently, there are mainly two versions: V8-R3 

and V8-R6, each with different compatible drivers and licenses.

## R6 Features

KingbaseES-R6 is fully compatible with PostgreSQL natively. For detailed information, you can refer to the PostgreSQL documentation. In the Oracle compatibility mode, all identifiers are lowercase by default, including the `pg_` prefix and `SYS_` prefix. When using the Oracle mode in R6, be cautious, as table and column names enclosed in `ALL UPPERCASE` will be automatically converted to lowercase.
