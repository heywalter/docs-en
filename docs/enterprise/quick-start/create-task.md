# Create a Data Pipeline

Through Tapdata, you can achieve data synchronization between different data sources and process data during its transfer. Depending on your business needs, you can choose to create the following types of tasks:

| Task Type                                                      | Applicable Scenarios                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Create Data Replication Tasks](../user-guide/data-pipeline/copy-data/create-task.md) | Quickly achieve real-time synchronization between the same/heterogeneous data sources in just a few steps, suitable for various business scenarios such as data migration/synchronization, data disaster recovery, and read performance scaling. |
| [Create Data Transformation Tasks](../user-guide/data-pipeline/data-development/create-task.md) | Quickly meet advanced data processing needs such as multi-table merging, data splitting, field addition/removal, and shared mining by adding various processing nodes between source/target data sources. |
