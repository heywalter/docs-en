# What is Tapdata On-Prem

[Tapdata](https://tapdata.net) is a platform-centric product designed for data services, aimed at assisting enterprises in breaking down data silos and facilitating rapid data delivery. Leveraging real-time data synchronization, it enhances data transfer efficiency. Moreover, it supports task creation through a low-code approach, where simple drag-and-drop actions suffice, significantly reducing development complexity and shortening project launch timelines.

## Why Choose Tapdata On-Prem

Unlike traditional data migration/synchronization tools, Tapdata offers a rich-feature, easy-to-use, and secure data flow service. It also supports instant API publishing to boost data development efficiency.

* **Minimal Impact on Source Databases**

  Utilizing proprietary CDC log parsing technology for zero-intrusion real-time data collection, it virtually leaves the source databases unaffected. Additionally, it supports sharing incremental data to avoid redundant reads of the source database's incremental logs.

* **High Data Consistency**

  Based on a variety of proprietary technologies, it ensures high consistency between target and source data, supporting multiple verification methods to meet the stringent requirements of production environments.

* **End-to-End Real-Time**

  Unlike traditional ETL, each new piece of data entering the platform is responded to, computed, processed, and written into the target table within seconds.

* **Code-Free Operation Interface**

  Say goodbye to SQL and coding; with simple mouse dragging and dropping, you can quickly complete tasks like renaming tables and transforming rules, achieving **real-time data synchronization** between different types of databases.
