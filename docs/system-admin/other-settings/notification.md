The subject and body support the following insertable variables: `{taskName}` (task name), `{errorTime}` (error time), and `{errorLog}` (error log). You can quickly insert them by clicking the variable names at the bottom of the page.

## Webhook Alerts

With the Webhook alert feature, you can quickly integrate with your alert platform or third-party platform by simply providing the service URL. This allows for more notification methods, such as instant messaging platforms.
