# Operation Log

TapData Cloud uses the operation log to record user actions while using the system. You can view the recent activity log and filter the action log by applying the filter.



## Procedure

1. [Log in to TapData Platform](../user-guide/log-in.md) as a system administrator.

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Operation log**.

   On this page, you can view the username, operation time, operation object, operation type, and description for each action log. The list can be filtered to quickly locate specific action logs.
