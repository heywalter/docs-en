## <span id="release330-upgrade">How to Perform a Rolling Upgrade?</span>

Starting with version 3.3.0, TapData supports rolling upgrades. Compared to the standard downtime upgrade, it helps shorten the upgrade window and further reduce business impact. The specific steps are as follows:

:::tip

Ensure compatibility between the two versions before and after the upgrade. It is recommended to perform the upgrade when tasks have entered the incremental phase or during off-peak hours.

:::

1. Log into the server hosting TapData, keeping the original version of the TapData service running.

2. Download and unzip the 3.3.0 version installation package, then enter the package directory.

3. Execute the following command to complete the rolling upgrade process. Upon completion, you will be prompted: `Update finished. All Task are running.`.

   ```bash
   ./tapdata upgrade --source <old_version_path>
   ```

   `old_version_path`: The directory where the old version of TapData is installed, for example:

   ```bash
   ./tapdata upgrade --source /root/320/tapdata/
   ```

   :::tip

   If you encounter errors during the upgrade, executing the upgrade command again will continue from where it left off. To reset the upgrade status, execute `./tapdata upgrade reset`.

   :::

4. After the upgrade, log into the TapData platform, click on the username in the upper right corner, and select system version to confirm the upgrade was successful.

5. In the TapData platform's left navigation bar, select **System Management** > **Cluster Management** and confirm all services are running normally.

## How to Scale the TapData Cluster?

When facing performance bottlenecks, nearing resource limits, or needing to improve system fault tolerance and high availability, you can scale the cluster. The specific operation process is as follows:

1. Complete the environment initialization for the new machine.

    1. Log into the server and execute the following commands to set file access numbers, firewall, and other system parameters.

       ```bash
       ulimit -n 1024000 
       echo "* soft nofile 1024000" >> /etc/security/limits.conf 
       echo "* hard nofile 1024000" >> /etc/security/limits.conf 
       systemctl disable firewalld.service 
       systemctl stop firewalld.service 
       setenforce 0 
       sed -i "s/enforcing/disabled/g" /etc/selinux/config 
       ```

    2. Install Java version 1.8.

       ```bash
       yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk
       ```

    3. Set the system time.

       ```bash
       # Method 1: use ntpdate
       # nptdate -u cn.ntp.org.cn
       crontab -e 
       # Add at the last line
       * */1 * * * ntpdate -u ntp1.aliyun.com
       
       # Method 2: specify with date -s
       date -s '10:34:06'
       
       # Sync system time to hardware to prevent time reset after system reboot
       hwclock -w
       ```

2. Download the TapData installation package (you can [contact us](mailto:team@tapdata.io) to obtain it) and upload it to the device to be deployed.

3. On the device to be deployed, execute the following command to unzip the installation package and enter the unzipped path.

   ```bash
   tar -zxvf installation_package_name && cd tapdata
   ```

   Example: `tar -zxvf tapdata-release-v2.14.tar.gz && cd tapdata `

4. Complete the scaling operation on the device to be deployed.

    1. Copy the **application.yml** file from the existing node's TapData working directory to the working directory of the device to be deployed, then comment out or delete the line containing **uuid** in that file.

    2. Upload the License file to the TapData working directory.

    3. Start and scale the required services.

       ```bash
       # Scale TapData management service
       ./tapdata start frontend
       
       # Scale TapData API service
       ./tapdata start apiserver
       
       # Scale TapData engine service
       ./tapdata start backend
       ```

5. After successful startup, you can log into the TapData platform and check the status of various services under **System Management** > **Cluster Management**.



## How to Ensure High Availability for MongoDB Dependent by TapData?

Avoid using a single-node architecture. Use a [replica set deployment architecture](production-deploy/install-replica-mongodb.md) to ensure high availability. For instance, in a three-node replica set architecture, one node acts as the Primary node, and the other nodes act as Secondary nodes.

:::tip

If you are currently using a single-node architecture, you can [convert it to a replica set architecture](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/).

:::

In a replica set, data written to the Primary node are automatically synchronized to the Secondary nodes. If the Primary node fails or becomes unavailable, the replica set automatically elects a new Primary node to ensure database availability and data integrity, minimizing the downtime and impact of database failures.

You can log into the MongoDB database and use the `rs.status()` command to check the status of the replica set and the state of each node. For more information, see [Replication](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/replication/).


## How to View Running Logs?

In versions prior to 2.15, logs were scattered across various folders in the TapData installation directory. Starting from version 2.15, log information is centralized in the logs directory within the installation directory.


## Where Are TapData Configuration Files Stored?

The TapData configuration file: **application.yml** is located in the TapData installation directory. It contains key configuration information, such as available memory settings, service ports, MongoDB database connection information, etc.


## How to Adjust the Available Memory Size for Java?

By default, the available memory is set to 4 GB. To adjust it, go to the **application.yml** file in the TapData installation directory, edit the file, and adjust the memory configuration information according to the server's available memory and task load. For example, configuring it as `tapdataJavaOpts: "-Xms8G -Xmx16G"` means the initial memory is 8G, and the maximum memory is 16G, as shown below:

```yaml
tapdata:
    cloud:
        accessCode: ""
        retryTime: '3'
        baseURLs: ""
    mode: cluster
    conf:
        tapdataPort: '3030'
        backendUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:3030/api/'
        apiServerPort: '3080'
        apiServerErrorCode: 'true'
        tapdataJavaOpts: ""
        SCRIPT_DIR: etc
        reportInterval: 20000
        uuid: 093288a0-9ab9-4752-bd1c-7163aea4a7ba
        Decimal128ToNumber: 'false'
        tapdataTMJavaOpts: '-Xmx8G -Xms16G'
```

:::tip

If the memory allocation is small but the task load is heavy, the Java program may continuously perform garbage collection due to insufficient available memory, causing a spike in CPU usage.

## Management Subprocess Keeps Restarting, How to Troubleshoot?

1. Check whether the MongoDB engine used as TapData's storage can be normally connected and that its version is 4.0 or above.
2. Execute `./tapdata restart frontend`, then find the frontendDebug.log file in the logs directory and review it. Analyze the specific reason for the problem through the error messages in the log.



## What Are the Rules for Task Scheduling?

- When a task starts: Query the number of tasks each alive engine is running and schedule the task to the engine with the smallest number of running tasks.
- Heartbeat timeout: The engine will send heartbeat messages to the tasks it takes over. After a heartbeat timeout, the task is rescheduled to the alive engine with the smallest number of running tasks.
- Takeover timeout: After being scheduled to an alive engine, if the task is not taken over by the engine within the timeout period, the task is rescheduled to the alive engine with the smallest number of running tasks.


## How Does TapData Achieve High Availability?

You can [deploy TapData on multiple machines](production-deploy/install-tapdata-ha.md) to achieve high availability. If one node experiences an anomaly, other nodes can continue to provide services. Tasks that have entered the incremental phase will resume from the breakpoint, and tasks can be automatically balanced and distributed.


## A Task Encounters an Exception, How to Troubleshoot?

Although the reasons for task exceptions may vary, you can refer to the following general troubleshooting process:

1. Log into the TapData platform, find the target task, and review the specific error message. Make adjustments based on the error message (e.g., table does not exist).

2. Log into the machine hosting TapData, go to the TapData installation directory, and review more log information.

3. If you cannot log into the TapData platform, execute `./tapdata status` on its hosting machine to check if the services are running normally.

   ```bash
   ./tapdata status
    _______       _____  _____       _______
   |__   __|/\   |  __ \|  __ \   /\|__   __|/\    
      | |  /  \  | |__) | |  | | /  \  | |  /  \   
      | | / /\ \ |  ___/| |  | |/ /\ \ | | / /\ \  
      | |/ ____ \| |    | |__| / ____ \| |/ ____ \ 
      |_/_/    \_\_|    |_____/_/    \_\_/_/    \_\ 
   
   WORK DIR:/root/tapdata
   Tapdata was stopped.
   Tapdata Engine PID:
   Tapdata Management PID:
   API Server Controller PID:
   API Server Instances PID:
   ```

   As shown in the example above, if the services are stopped, you can execute `./tapdata start` to start the relevant services.


## Synchronization Performance is Poor, How to Troubleshoot?

For synchronization performance issues, we need to decompose the execution process of the task into source, destination, and engine, and then identify the potential bottleneck node.

- **Destination**: Replace logic. For example, replace the destination with DummyDB to observe the task execution. If there is a significant performance improvement, it can be preliminarily determined that the problem lies with the destination side. Start the detailed investigation from there.
- **Engine**: Trace logic. Sort each processing node of the engine by processing time delay to find the information of the top N longest delay nodes for detailed investigation. Then, create a clone of the problem task and trace each entity data from source to destination, recording the delay of the data passing through the engine processing nodes. Output the most detailed log information to identify the specific problem cause of the problem node.
- **Source**: Exclusion logic. Since TapData's implementation for different sources varies, the method to determine whether a problem is related to the source is to first ensure the problem is not related to the destination and engine. Then, based on the specific situation of the source, determine the investigation strategy.

Additionally, we also need to consider the processing delays and network transmission delays in different stages.



## The MongoDB Database Dependent by TapData Experiences an Exception, How to Troubleshoot?

MongoDB database exceptions can have various causes. The general troubleshooting process is as follows:

1. Check hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, and disk space. If resources are insufficient or disk space is exhausted, it might cause database exceptions.

2. Review MongoDB log files, especially the logs of the last few startups. Log files typically record warnings, errors, exceptions, etc., which can help identify the source of the problem.

   You can also log into the database through the mongo shell to view more information. For more information, see [getLog](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/getLog/).

3. Log into the MongoDB database and execute the `db.serverStatus()` command to view the current database status and statistics, analyzing if there are performance issues. For more information, see [serverStatus](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/).

4. Try using MongoDB's built-in tools for troubleshooting, such as `mongotop` to view the read and write operations of each collection, and `mongostat` to view the server's activity status.


## What Is the Database Name in the MongoDB Database Dependent by TapData, and What Are the Collections?

The adopted database name is tapdata. You can log into the database through the mongo shell to see the specific collections included, as shown below:

```bash
# Enter the tapdata database
use tapdata;

# Show the collections in the current database
show collections;

# View the data in a specific collection
db.ClusterState.find();
```

Focus on the following collections, which may change with version updates:

- ClusterState: Cluster state information
- ClusterStateLog: Cluster state logs
- Connections: Connection source property information
- DatabaseTypes: Supported data source types (dictionary data)
- DataCatalog: Data catalog information
- DataFlows: Task property status information
- DataFlowStage: Task property stage information
- DeleteCaches: Cached delete data
- Events: Notification events of task execution
- Jobs: Task execution process information
- LineageGraph: Data map
- Logs: Log information
- Message: Messages
- MessageQueue: Message queue
- MetadataDefinition: Metadata definitions
- MetadataInstances: Metadata information
- Modules: Data publishing - API publication information
- nodeConfig: Custom node configuration information
- Permission: Permission information (dictionary data)
- Role: Roles
- RoleMapping: Roles and their permissions
- ScheduleTasks: Task scheduling information
- Settings: System settings information
- User: User information
- UserLogs: User operation information
- Workers: Process information
- License: License information
- TypeMappings: Type mappings



## How to Confirm if Alert Emails Were Successfully Sent?

TapData supports [sending alert emails via the SMTP](../case-practices/best-practice/alert-via-qqmail.md) protocol to help users stay informed about operational anomalies and ensure the stability of tasks.

In case end users report not receiving alert emails, administrators can follow these steps to troubleshoot the email sending process:

1. Log in to the MongoDB database that TapData depends on.

2. Enter the `tapdata` database and execute the following command:

   ```sql
   db.Events.find().sort({_id: -1})
   ```

   This command will display the latest alert event records in reverse chronological order.

3. **Analyze Key Fields**:

   - If the record contains `successful`, it means the email was sent successfully.
   - If the record contains `failed`, the email sending failed. You can check the value of the `fail_message` field to analyze the specific failure reason.



## What Are High-Risk Operations?

By closely reviewing system high-risk operations, timely identification and response to potential threats can ensure data security, integrity, and availability in system operations. Understanding various high-risk operations helps establish reliable platform management systems, permission management systems, and improves the recognition of various security challenges, thus laying the foundation for the company's data processing procedures and platform management standards.

Common high-risk operations include:

* [Connection Management](../connectors/README.md)
    * **Deleting data source connections**: To avoid accidental deletion, when performing a deletion operation, a prompt will appear if the connection is referenced by a task.
    * **Editing data source connections**: If the parameters of the data source are set incorrectly, it may cause the connection to fail. Tasks referencing this data source will use the previous parameters and will not be affected, but new tasks or tasks reset afterwards may trigger errors.
* [Data Replication](../user-guide/copy-data/create-task.md)/[Data Transformation](../user-guide/data-development/create-task.md) Tasks
    * **Resetting tasks**: This operation will reset the task to its initial state, clearing historical monitoring data. Subsequent task starts will require re-executing full data synchronization.
    * **Data duplication processing strategy**: In the target node settings, setting different data duplication strategies will affect the structure and data of the target table. For example, selecting **Clear existing target table structure and data** will clear the target table's structure and all data upon task start, synchronizing new table structures and data from the source.
    * **Setting data write strategy**: In the advanced settings of the target node, if append write is selected, TapData will only process insert events, discarding update and delete events. Choose carefully based on business needs to avoid the risk of data inconsistency.
    * **Setting synchronization index**: When

a data replication task is used for scenarios that only synchronize incremental data, i.e., retaining target table data, if the target table's data scale is large, the synchronization index operation may affect the overall performance of the target database.
* **Setting update condition fields**: If there is no index on the target, an index will be created based on the update condition fields.
* **Task Agent settings**: In the task settings in the upper right corner, if an Agent is manually specified, this configuration item will remain unchanged when the task is copied, which may cause excessive pressure on a single Agent. It is recommended to set it to **Automatically assigned by the platform**.
* [Data Services](../publish-apis/README.md)
    * Deleting or taking an API offline will render it unavailable.
* [System Management](../user-guide/manage-system/README.md)
    * When [managing a cluster](../system-admin/manage-cluster.md), only perform close or restart operations on related services when they are experiencing anomalies.
