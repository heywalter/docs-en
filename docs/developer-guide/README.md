# Developer Guide

**TapData Shell** (also known as TapShell) is a command-line toolkit provided by the TapData real-time data platform. Built on [Change Data Capture](../introduction/change-data-capture-mechanism.md) (CDC) technology, it enables users to efficiently execute streaming data processing tasks. In addition to using TapData through a [graphical interface](../user-guide/data-development/create-task.md), you can also leverage an interactive command-line or Python-based approach to process real-time data across homogeneous and heterogeneous databases. This supports flexible, automated data integration and streaming processing scenarios, such as building real-time wide tables and materialized views.

This section introduces the core functionalities and usage of TapData Shell:
