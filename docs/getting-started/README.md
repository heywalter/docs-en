# Getting Started

Welcome to TapData! This quick-start guide walks you through building a real-time data pipeline—from connecting sources to publishing analysis-ready APIs.

TapData’s **Incremental Materialized Views (IMVs)** let you define joins and transformations once, and automatically keep the results fresh in real time—ideal for analytics, applications, and APIs.

:::tip
If you’re looking to build a complete **Operational Data Hub (ODH)**, see the [ODH Handbook](../operational-data-hub/plan-data-platform.md) for the full architecture and design approach.  
For now, this guide gives you a fast way to experience TapData’s core capabilities.
