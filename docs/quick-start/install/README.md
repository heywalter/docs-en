Tapdata offers two deployment modes, **Cloud** and **Enterprise**, to meet your diversified needs:

| Product         | Applicable Scenarios                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tapdata Cloud   | Sign up for a [Tapdata Cloud](https://cloud.tapdata.net/console/v3/) account for use. Suitable for scenarios requiring rapid deployment and low initial investment, helping you focus more on business development rather than infrastructure management. |
| Tapdata Enterprise | Supports deployment to local data centers. Suitable for scenarios with strict requirements on data sensitivity or network isolation, such as financial institutions, government departments, or large enterprises that want full control over their data. |
