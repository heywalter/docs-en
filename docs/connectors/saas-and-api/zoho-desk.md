# Zoho Desk



Zoho Desk is a cloud-based customer service platform that supports ticket management, customer communication, and service automation. By integrating Zoho Desk as a data source in TapData, you can stream key data such as tickets, contacts, and conversations in real time. This is ideal for building unified customer service views, customer profiles, and service response monitoring systems.

## Supported Data

TapData reads Zoho Desk data in a table-like format and syncs it to target systems. The table names correspond to Zoho Desk modules as follows:

- **Tickets**: Ticket records
- **Departments**: Department records
- **Products**: Product records
- **OrganizationFields**: Custom field definitions
- **Contracts**: Contract records

## Notes

- Each Zoho Desk data source requires a unique service URL to ensure proper WebHook delivery.
- Since Zoho Desk limits the number of OpenAPI tokens per client, avoid using the same Client ID and Secret across multiple data sources to prevent throttling.
- In WebHook incremental mode, Zoho Desk marks deleted records with `IsDel = TRUE` in update events. Note: if a task is reset and restarted, these deletions will not be retrieved via full sync again.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Zoho Desk to TapData, follow these steps to retrieve authentication credentials:

1. Obtain Organization ID.

   1. Log in to [Zoho Desk](https://www.zoho.com/).

   2. Click the ![settings](../../images/setting_icon.png) icon in the top-right, search for **APIs**, and open the API authentication page to view the Organization ID.

2. Obtain Client ID and Secret.

   1. Go to the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/) and click **GET STARTED**.

   2. Under **Self Client**, click **CREATE NOW**.

   3. Click **CREATE**, then confirm with **OK**.

   4. You will now receive the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, which will be used in TapData.

3. Generate Authorization Code.

   1. Navigate to the **Generate Code** tab, enter the following **Scope**, authorization duration, and description, then click **CREATE**:

      ```bash
      Desk.tickets.ALL,Desk.search.READ,Desk.contacts.READ,Desk.contacts.WRITE,Desk.contacts.UPDATE,Desk.contacts.CREATE,Desk.tasks.ALL,Desk.basic.READ,Desk.basic.CREATE,Desk.settings.ALL,Desk.events.ALL,Desk.articles.READ,Desk.articles.CREATE,Desk.articles.UPDATE,Desk.articles.DELETE
      ```

   2. In the **Select Portal** section, choose the desired portal and environment (e.g., Production), then click **CREATE**.

   3. Copy or download the generated code and store it securely. You’ll need this to complete the data source connection.
