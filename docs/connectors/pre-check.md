# Task Pre-check



To ensure the normal operation of data replication/development tasks, when you save or start a task, TapData will conduct a pre-check based on node configuration and data source characteristics. Simultaneously, it prints the check results through logs, helping you avoid the risk of task execution failure and manage tasks more efficiently.

## Pre-check Logs Example

After the data replication/development task configuration is completed, execute save or start the task, and the pre-check information will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Relevant examples are as follows:

## Task Settings Check

| Check Item                 | Log Example                                                  |
