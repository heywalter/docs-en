# Hudi



[Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/cn/docs/overview) is a storage format for data lakes that provides the ability to update, delete, and consume change data on top of the Hadoop file system. TapData supports using Hudi as a **target database** to build data transfer pipelines.

## Environment Requirements

The machine running the compute engine should have Hadoop environment variables configured. The Hadoop version should match the version installed on your server. You can check if your machine meets the requirements by running the `hadoop -version` command.
