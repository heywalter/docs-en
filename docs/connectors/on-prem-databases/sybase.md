[Sybase Database](https://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp), also known as Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE), is a high-performance, reliable, and scalable enterprise-grade relational database management system. Sybase is nearing the end of its support lifecycle, and it is recommended to migrate to other databases to reduce risk. With TapData, you can easily build real-time synchronization pipelines to sync Sybase data to other database platforms, ensuring business continuity.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Supported Operations

DML Operations: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

:::tip

- When Sybase is used as a target, you can select the write strategy through the advanced settings of the task node: in case of insert conflicts, you can choose to convert to an update or discard the record; in case of update failures, you can choose to convert to an insert.
- For Sybase to PostgreSQL synchronization scenarios, extra support is provided for synchronizing **indexes**, **foreign key constraints**, and **sequences**.

:::

## Limitations

- DDL event capture and application are not supported. If a DDL event occurs during synchronization, you must stop the task and re-run a full data sync.

- Due to Sybase limitations, if multiple synchronization tasks are enabled on the same database, you must enable **[Shared Mining](../../operational-data-hub/advanced/share-mining.md)** in the Sybase connection and task configurations to prevent new tasks from failing to correctly sync incremental data.

- Due to Sybase's cache limitations when executing SQL statements, if you encounter the error **"Procedure cache exhausted before a query plan could be found."** while loading the schema, you can adjust the cache size by running the following command:

  ```sql
  sp_configure 'procedure cache size', 20000;
  ```

## Considerations

- When performing real-time incremental synchronization from Sybase as a source, TapData will set log checkpoints to prevent log cleanup, advancing every 10 minutes, which may consume additional disk space. Suspended incremental tasks can cause transaction logs to accumulate, so it's recommended to promptly delete unneeded tasks or manually reset tasks that have been paused for a long time.
- The full data synchronization phase may consume database and bandwidth resources, so ensure that sufficient hardware resources are available. The load impact during incremental synchronization is generally within 5%.

## <span id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</span>

1. Log in to the Sybase database using a user with DBA privileges.

2. Create a user for data synchronization tasks.

   ```sql
   create login <username> with password <password>
   sp_displaylogin <username>
   sp_role 'grant',replication_role,<username>
   ```

   - `<username>`: The username to be created.
   - `<password>`: The password for the user.

3. Execute the following SQL commands to grant permissions to the newly created user.

   ```mdx-code-block
   <Tabs className="unique-tabs">
   <TabItem value="As Source Database" default>
   ```

   ```sql
   sp_configure 'number of aux scan descriptors', 5000; 
   sp_dboption <database_name>, 'ddl in tran', 'true'
   sp_role 'grant',sa_role,<username>
   sp_role 'grant',sybase_ts_role,<username>
   ```

   </TabItem>
   
   <TabItem value="As Target Database">
   
   ```sql
   USE <database_name>;
   sp_addalias <username>, dbo
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   - `<database_name>`: The name of the database to grant permissions.
   - `<username>`: The username to be granted permissions.
   - `<password>`: The password for the user.

## Connect to Sybase

1. [Log in to TapData platform](../../user-guide/log-in.md).

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Connections**.

3. On the right side of the page, click **Create**.

4. In the dialog that appears, search for and select **Sybase**.

5. On the following page, fill in the connection information for Sybase based on the instructions below.

   ![Sybase Connection Settings](../../images/sybase_connection.png)

   * **Connection Information**
     * **Name**: Enter a unique, meaningful name.
     * **Type**: Sybase can be used as a source or target database.
     * **Host**: The database connection address.
     * **Port**: The database service port.
     * **Database**: The name of the database. Each connection corresponds to one database; if there are multiple databases, multiple connections need to be created.
     * **Schema**: The schema name.
     * **Username**: The database username.
     * **Password**: The password associated with the database account.
     * **Byte Order**: Choose between big-endian and little-endian based on the machine architecture. For example, Linux machines typically use little-endian, while some dedicated Sybase machines use big-endian. Incorrect configuration may cause inconsistent data during the incremental synchronization phase.
   * **Advanced Settings**
      * **Shared Mining**: [Mining the source database's](../../operational-data-hub/advanced/share-mining.md) incremental logs allows multiple tasks to share the same source databaseâ€™s incremental log mining process, reducing duplicate reads and minimizing the impact of incremental synchronization on the source database. After enabling this feature, you will need to select external storage to store the incremental log information.
      * **Include Tables**: Default is **All**. You can customize and specify the topics to include by separating table names with commas (`,`).
      * **Exclude Tables**: When enabled, you can specify topics to exclude, separated by commas (`,`).
      * **Agent Settings**: Defaults to **Platform Automatic Allocation**, but you can manually assign an agent.
      * **Model Loading Time**: If the data source has fewer than 10,000 models, they will be updated hourly. If the number exceeds this threshold, models will be reloaded daily at a time you specify.

6. Click **Test**. Once the test is successful, click **Save**.

   :::tip

   If the connection test fails, follow the on-screen instructions to resolve the issue.

## Advanced Node Features

When configuring Sybase as a source or target node for synchronization or transformation tasks, TapData offers several advanced features to optimize performance and handle complex scenarios:

- **Incremental Synchronization of LOB Types**: Supports the synchronization of TEXT, IMAGE, BYTE, CLOB, and BLOB data types using two methods:
  - **Log Parsing**: No need to access the source database; suitable for scenarios without primary or unique keys, but performance may be lower.
  - **Source Table Lookup**: Queries the source database to look up LOB objects, offering higher performance and suitable for scenarios with primary or unique keys.
- **Auto Encoding/Decoding**: Supports automatic conversion of all synchronized data based on configured character encodings, ensuring character set consistency and avoiding data issues caused by encoding discrepancies.
