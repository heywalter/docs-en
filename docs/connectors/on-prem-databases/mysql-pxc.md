# MySQL PXC



Please follow the instructions below to successfully add and use MySQL PXC databases in TapData.

## Supported Versions

MySQL PXC 5.0, 5.1, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 8.x

## Prerequisites (As a Source)

### Enable Binlog

- MySQL PXC's binlog must be enabled for TapData to perform synchronization properly.
- Cascade deletes, which are generated by the database, are not recorded in the binlog and are therefore not supported. Modify `$MYSQL_HOME/mysql.cnf`, for example:

```
server_id         = 223344
log_bin           = mysql-bin
expire_logs_days  = 1
binlog_format     = row
binlog_row_image  = full
```

Explanation of the configuration:
server-id: Must be unique for each server and replication client in MySQL PXC.
binlog_format: Must be set to row or ROW.
binlog_row_image: Must be set to full.
expire_logs_days: Number of days to retain binary log files; they will be automatically deleted when they expire.
log_bin: Base name of the binary log sequence files.

### Restart MySQL PXC

```
/etc/init.d/mysqld restart
```

To verify that binlog is enabled, execute the following command in the MySQL shell:

```
show variables like 'binlog_format';
```

The output's format value should be "ROW".

To verify if the binlog_row_image parameter's value is "full":

```
show variables like 'binlog_row_image';
```

The output's binlog_row_image value should be "FULL".

### Create MySQL PXC Account

For MySQL 8 and later versions, the encryption method for passwords is different. Make sure to use the corresponding method for your version to set the password; otherwise, it will result in inability to perform incremental synchronization.

**For 5.x Versions (3.3.1)**

```sql
create user 'username'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
```

**For 8.x Versions (3.3.2)**

```sql
-- Create user
create user 'username'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';
-- Change password
alter user 'username'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';
```

### Grant Permissions

Grant SELECT permission for a specific database:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, LOCK TABLES ON <DATABASE_NAME>.<TABLE_NAME> TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Grant global permissions:

```sql
GRANT RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

### Constraints Note

When synchronizing from MySQL PXC to other heterogeneous databases, if the source MySQL PXC has table-level cascade settings, data updates and deletions triggered by those cascades will not be propagated to the target. If you need to build cascade processing capabilities on the target side, you can use triggers or other means to achieve this type of data synchronization.
