# Creating a Client

An API client is used to manage and create API calls. Applications designed and developed by developers, or other applications that need to call API interfaces (collectively referred to as client applications), need to be registered before accessing the data publishing system. After registration, you receive a unique client ID (client_id) and client secret (client_secret).

## Procedure

1. Log in to the Tapdata.

2. In the left navigation bar, select **Data Services** > **Clients**.

3. Click **Create a Client** in the top right corner, fill in the relevant information, and click **OK**.

   The client secret is an important basis for client applications to obtain API access authorization and should be properly stored to avoid transmission in public network environments.
