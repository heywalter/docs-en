# Real-Time Data Hub


The Real-Time Data Hub supports two modes, catering to different data governance needs.

* **[Data Integration Platform Mode](etl-mode)**: Suitable for data replication/synchronization, cloud migration, or building ETL pipelines. You simply drag and drop source tables to the target to automatically create data replication tasks.

* **[Data Service Platform Mode](daas-mode)**: Based on the concept of data layer governance, this mode synchronizes data scattered across different business systems to a unified platform cache layer, minimizing the impact of data extraction on operations. It provides foundational data for subsequent data processing and business operations, thus building a consistent, real-time data platform and connecting data silos.
