# Data Transformation

TapData's Data Transformation capabilities enable you to build sophisticated data processing pipelines that go beyond simple replication. Whether you're creating real-time materialized views, merging multiple data sources, or applying complex business logic, our transformation tools provide the flexibility and performance you need.

## Getting Started

* **Data Processing Tasks**
Create comprehensive [data transformation pipelines](create-task.md) with processing nodes for filtering, field modifications, data type conversions, and custom business logic. Perfect for ETL workflows and data preparation.


* **Incremental Materialized Views (IMV)**
Build [real-time, high-performance views](create-views/README.md) that automatically update as source data changes. Combine data from multiple sources to accelerate insights and decision-making.
