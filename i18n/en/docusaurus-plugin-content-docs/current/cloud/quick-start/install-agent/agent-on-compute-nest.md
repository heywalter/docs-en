# Install on Compute Nest

Under the traditional cloud deployment model, we need to complete complex processes such as purchasing ECS(Elastic Compute Service), preparing the environment, and configuring security policies. Due to the high reliance on manual experience, delivery cycles and quality are difficult to guarantee. 

In order to further improve the convenience and security of deployment, Tapdata helps users to deploy Tapdata Agent in a secure network environment through [Alibaba Cloud Computing Nest](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/290066.html). This realizes the efficiency upgrade of the whole service life cycle of deployment, delivery, operation and maintenance, and greatly reduces the threshold of use.

## Prerequisites
