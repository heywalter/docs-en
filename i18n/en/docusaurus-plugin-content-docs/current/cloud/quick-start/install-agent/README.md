# Step 1: Install Agent

The Tapdata Agent is an essential component for data synchronization, data heterogeneity, and data pipeline scenarios. While it is recommended to install the Tapdata Agent within the local network where the database is located for real-time processing, an alternative option is available. You can also install the Tapdata Agent on the Tapdata Cloud server, eliminating the need for setting up a machine locally. This provides flexibility and convenience for managing your data flow.



Tapdata Cloud offers pricing based on the specifications and quantity of subscribed Agent instances. You have the option to create one free instance of the **SMALL** specification Agent, and if required, you can [purchase additional Agent instances](../../billing/billing-overview.md) to align with your specific business requirements.

Tapdata Agent plays a critical role in the data flow process. It retrieves data from the source, performs necessary processing and transformations, and subsequently transfers it to the designated target. It is important to note that the data being handled by the Tapdata Agent is not uploaded or stored in Tapdata Cloud. The agent acts as a facilitator, ensuring efficient and secure data transfer without retaining any data in the cloud environment.
