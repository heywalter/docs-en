# Step 1: Install Agent

Tapdata Agent is a key program in data synchronization, data heterogeneity, and data pipeline scenarios. The Tapdata Agent should be installed in the local network where the database is located since data flow is usually time-sensitive.

Tapdata Cloud charges based on the specifications and quantity of subscribed Agent instances. You can create one **SMALL** specification Agent instance for free, and additionally, you can [purchase more Agent instances](../../billing/billing-overview.md) to meet your business needs.

Tapdata Agent obtains data from the source, processes and transforms it, then sends it to its target. The data is not uploaded or stored in Tapdata Cloud.
