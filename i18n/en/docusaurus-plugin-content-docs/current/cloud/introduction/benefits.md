# Benefits

## Innovative Real-time Data Synchronization

Tapdata Cloud innovatively combines database CDC with streaming computing technology, simplifying the data processing process and enabling users to leverage innovative possibilities beyond simple data synchronization.

## Unified Data Service Platform

Based on the concept of data hierarchical governance, data scattered in different business systems can be synchronized to a unified platform cache layer, which minimizes the impact of data extraction on business and provides basic data for subsequent data processing and business, thus building a consistent, real-time data platform and connecting data silos.

## Zero Code Visual Drag and Drop

The orchestration and setup process for Tapdata Cloud data synchronization tasks supports drag-and-drop visualization operations without the need for coding. It also supports multi-level, multi-node synchronization operations, significantly reducing the complexity of defining synchronization task flows and improving efficiency and quality.

## Perfect Support for SQL - > NoSQL

The comprehensive JSON support can easily realize real-time synchronization from the relational database to non-relational data through drag-and-drop operations. It also support one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many, and other modeling methods, which can easily help users to modernize the database.

## Comprehensive Database Support

 Tapdata Cloud provides comprehensive support for major open source databases, commercial databases, and messaging middleware, including MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Sybase, PostgreSQL, Redis, GaussDB, and more.

## Visual Task Run Monitoring

With the visual interface, users can monitor the operation status of tasks and quickly access statistics on data reading, data writing, and delay for various tasks and nodes.

## Fully Designed Security

Security design priority for user data, user information, and task information encryption throughout the security measures to fully protect the user's data and information. For more introduction, see [Architecture and Workflow](architecture.md).
