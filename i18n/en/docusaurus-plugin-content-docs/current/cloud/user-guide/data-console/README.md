# Data Console(Beta)

Data Console supports two models to meet the data governance demand:

[Data Integration Mode](etl-mode)（default）：Suitable for data replication/synchronization, migrate data to cloud or building ETL pipelines. You can simply drag the source table to the target to automatically complete the creation of data replication tasks.

[Data Service Platform](daas-mode)：Based on the concept of data hierarchical governance, data scattered in different business systems can be synchronized to a unified platform cache layer, which minimizes the impact of data extraction on business and provides basic data for subsequent data processing and business, thus building a consistent, real-time data platform and connecting data silos.
