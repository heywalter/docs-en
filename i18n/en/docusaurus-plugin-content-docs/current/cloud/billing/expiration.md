# Expiration Policy

To prevent any disruptions to your business operations, we highly recommend [renewing](renew-subscribe.md) your annual/monthly instance before it expires. Alternatively, during the initial subscription process, you can choose the continuous annual/monthly payment method. This ensures seamless continuity of your instance and avoids any potential impact on your business.



After the expiration of a subscribed Agent instance, the following effects can be observed:

* The associated tasks can continue to run, but they will be unable to execute any scheduled policies within the tasks.
* The data source associated with the Agent will be unable to load the Schema.
* New tasks associated with the Agent cannot be started.
* The data source associated with the Agent cannot undergo a connection test.

It is important to keep these effects in mind and ensure timely renewal or consider the appropriate actions to maintain uninterrupted functionality and data source operations for your Agent instance.
