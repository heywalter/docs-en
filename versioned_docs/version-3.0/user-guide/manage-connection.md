TapData saves the connection information for each database using a connection, allowing you to reference it directly when creating data replication/development tasks. This eliminates the need for repetitive configuration and improves the convenience of operation and maintenance. 

This article provides a guide on the common operations for managing connections.

## Procedure

1. [Log in to TapData Platform](log-in.md).

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Connections**.

3. Select the actions you want to perform.

   * **Filter connections**: You can quickly filter connections based on their status, connection type, database type, or search by connection name.
   * **Connection test**: You can test the validity of a connection to check if it is functioning properly. If any abnormalities are found, you can troubleshoot the issue by following the prompts in the dialog box.
   * **Load Schema**: Manually loads database schema information.
   * **Edit**: Modify the name and configuration information of the connection.
   * **Copy**: Quickly clone a connection with the same configuration based on the specified connection.
   * **Delete**: If you no longer need a connection, you can delete it, but keep in mind that it cannot be recovered.
